<p><b>Instructions for the Drop/Add application!</b></p>
<p>Here's what you can do with this application:<br />&bull; Search the Class Schedule for courses.<br />&bull; Add or Drop a course.<br />&bull; Change the grade track for a course.</p>
<p><b>Dropping a Course</b></p>
<p>&bull; Students are required to be registered in every block.  Dropping a course must be replaced with another course.<br />&bull; To drop a course, scroll to the &ldquo;Course Drop and Grading Track Changes&rdquo; section and use the drop-down list next to the course you wish to drop, and then choose &ldquo;drop&rdquo;.<br />&bull; You will then be asked to add a new course. The &ldquo;Course Drop and Grading Track Changes&rdquo; section freezes until you choose and add a new course.<br />&bull; Follow the instructions for adding a course through completion.<br />&bull; Grading Track changes cannot be performed while executing a course drop. Any Grading Track changes performed while executing a course drop will be restored to their original values.<br />&bull; You can always click &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; to restore your initial course schedule.</p>
<p><b>Changing a Grading Track</b></p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Letter Grades&rdquo; track applies to specific grades (like A, B-, C+, etc.) which impact your GPA.<br />&bull; &ldquo;Optional Grades&rdquo; track applies to more general grades (like S/CR/NC) which may impact your GPA depending on grade received. Refer to the Grading Standards section of The Pathfinder.<br />&bull; The &ldquo;Audit&rdquo; track does not give you a grade and does not impact your GPA.<br />&bull; You can modify the grading track for a class by clicking on the corresponding drop-down list and choosing a different grading track, then clicking &ldquo;Apply Drops and Grading Track Changes&rdquo; at the bottom of this section.<br />&bull; Confirm your change and press &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to process your change, or press &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; to restore your initial grade track.</p>
<p><b>Adding a Course</b></p>
<p>&bull; Go to the &ldquo;Course Add&rdquo; section. You should see your name and student ID number.<br />&bull; If you happen to know the Term, CRN, and Grading Track of the class you wish to add, then just enter them here and click the Continue button.<br />&bull; If you need to look-up the CRN (Course Reference Number) for the class you wish to add, press the &ldquo;Search Class Schedule&rdquo; button and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.<br />&bull; Only the &ldquo;Term&rdquo; field is required, but please note that results are limited to the first 200 classes found, so include as many course identifiers as possible.<br />&bull; Once you have entered your filter(s), press the &ldquo;Class Search&rdquo; button to load the results of the search.<br />&bull; Find the class you wish to add and then click on the corresponding checkbox on the left. <br />&bull; This will populate the chosen course&rsquo;s CRN in the &ldquo;Course Add&rdquo; section above.<br />&bull; From this point you can select your desired Grading Track and then press the &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; button.<br />&bull; The course information for the Term and CRN is now displayed, so students can verify the selection before adding the class. Verify the class is correct and press the &ldquo;Add Course&rdquo; button. The class will be added to your schedule.<br />&bull; Note that when starting the process of adding a class, the Term, CRN, and Grading Track fields become locked for the current transaction. To unlock them and start over, press the &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; button.</p>
<p><b>Consent</b></p>
<p>&bull; Some classes require a consent before they can be dropped or added. Even a change to a Grading Track may require a consent.<br />&bull; If a consent is required, an additional input field will appear in the appropriate section. Enter in the consent code and then proceed as normal.<br />&bull; Depending on the class consent, you may need to contact your instructor or department chair, if unsure, please contact the Registrar&rsquo;s Office for more information, registrar@coloradocollege.edu or 719-389-6610.</p>
