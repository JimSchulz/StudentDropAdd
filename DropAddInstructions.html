<p>
    <b>Welcome to the Drop/Add application!</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Here's what you can do with this application:</b><br />
    &bull; Search the Class Schedule for courses.<br />
    &bull; Add or Drop a course.<br />
    &bull; Change the grade track for a course.<br />
    &bull; Add yourself to a waitlist.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Adding a Course</b><br />
    &bull; Adding a course to your schedule is extremely easy.<br />
	&bull; Go to the &ldquo;Course Add&rdquo; section. You should see your name and student ID number.<br />
	&bull; If you happen to know the Term, CRN, and Grading Track of the class you wish to add, then just enter them here and click the Continue button.<br />
	&bull; Alas, the above is not usually the norm. More often you will need to look-up the CRN (Course Reference Number) for the class you wish to add.<br />
	&bull; To look-up a class, press the &ldquo;Search Class Schedule&rdquo; button and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.<br />
	&bull; Here you will find filters to restrict your class search. Only the Term filter is required, but please note that results are limited to the first 200 classes found, so be as specific as possible.<br />
	&bull; Once you have chosen your filter, then press the &ldquo;Class Search&rdquo; button to load the results of the search.<br />
	&bull; Find the class you wish to add and then click on the corresponding checkbox on the left. This will then close this section and the Class Schedule Search section and the chosen Term and CRN will appear in the Course Add section above.<br />
	&bull; From this point you can select your desired Grading Track and then press the &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; button.<br />
	&bull; The course information for the Term and CRN entered is now displayed. This is done so that you can verify the chosen class before actually adding the class. If you&rsquo;re lucky, the &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; button now changes to an &ldquo;Add Course&rdquo; button. Verify the class is the one you want and press the &ldquo;Add Course&rdquo; button, and then, if all is in alignment, the class will be added to your schedule.<br />
	&bull; Note that when starting the process of adding a class, the Term, CRN, and Grading Track fields become locked for the current transaction. To unlock them and start over, press the &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; button.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Dropping a Course</b><br />
	&bull; All students are expected to be enrolled as full-time students. Therefore, you must be enrolled/registered (not waitlisted) each block. So when you try to drop a course you will also be required to add a course in the same block or the transaction will be cancelled.<br />
</p>
<p>
	<b>Changing a Grading Track</b><br />
	&bull; The Letter Grades track applies to specific grades (A, B-, C+, etc.) which impact your GPA.<br />
	&bull; Optional Grades track applies to more general grades (S/CR/NC) which impact your GPA but in a different way.<br />
	&bull; The Audit track does not give you a grade and does not impact your GPA.<br />
	&bull; You can modify the grading track for a class by clicking on the corresponding drop-down list and choosing a different grading track, then clicking &ldquo;Apply Drops and Grading Track Changes&rdquo; at the bottom of this section.<br />
	&bull; This will then ask you to confirm your change.<br />
	&bull; Press OK to process your change, or Cancel to go back from whence you came. This section will then refresh and you&rsquo;ll see the change displayed.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Adding a Waitlisted Course</b><br />
	&bull; If the course you are adding is full, you may add yourself to the waitlist, but remember that the add/drop system will require you to be registered and not just waitlisted for a course. Therefore, you will need to cancel the waitlist transaction and enroll/register yourself in a course that is open. Then, you may go back and add yourself the waitlisted course!
</p>
<p>
    <b>What could possibly go wrong?</b><br />
    &bull; As with many things in life, the Drop/Add process has many rules. At any given point in adding or dropping a class, or changing a grading track, you may bump up against one of these rules (aka: edits).<br />
    &bull; Edits appear in the form of an orange yellowish box within the corresponding section. Please read the edit. Be one with the message. Allow the thought to be processed.<br />
    &bull; Sometimes the edit is easy to resolve. Perhaps you forgot to enter something, or you&rsquo;re accidentally trying to add a class during a block that&rsquo;s in the past.<br />
    &bull; Sometimes the edit is beyond your control. In this case the Registrar&rsquo;s Office can help.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Consent</b><br />
	&bull; Some classes require a Consent of Instructor (COI) or Consent of Department (COD) before they can be dropped or added. <br />
    &bull; If a consent is required, you&rsquo;ll see an additional input field appear in the appropriate section. Enter in the consent code and then proceed as normal.<br />
    &bull; Where do I get my consent code? Good question! Sometimes class consent comes from your instructor. Sometimes it comes from the subject&rsquo;s department head. Other times your only recourse is to visit the Registrar&rsquo;s Office.
</p>
<p>
    <b>ADD FAILED</b><br />
	&bull; You must first be registered for a class first before adding yourself to a waitlist. Add yourself to a course first and then add yourself to this waitlist!
